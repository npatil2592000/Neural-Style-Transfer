# Neural-Style-Transfer
I got the idea for this project from the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai.
I this project I have used the concept of Neural Style Transfer.
I have used a pretrained vgg19 network with imagenet weights.
The pretrained model inputs one real life image and a painting.
It merges the contents of the real life message and the style of the painting.
The results are really outstanding and the genrated image looks very pleasing.
I have used tensorflow in this project.
